1. Introduction
Soccer player re-identification is a challenging task due to varying camera angles, player occlusions, similar team kits, and dynamic movements. This project implements a pipeline to address cross-camera player mapping by combining object detection with deep feature extraction and similarity-based matching.

2. Features
Player Detection: Utilizes a pre-trained Ultralytics YOLOv11 model (best.pt) for robust detection of players in video frames.

Feature Extraction: Employs a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network to extract discriminative visual features (embeddings) from detected player crops.

Cross-Camera Matching: Matches players between two video streams (broadcast and tacticam) based on the cosine similarity of their extracted features within a defined temporal window.

Consistent ID Assignment: Assigns a unique, persistent ID to each identified player across both video feeds.

CSV Output: Generates a CSV file (player_id_mapping.csv) detailing the frame-level matches and assigned player IDs.

Sample Visualization: Provides a visualization of YOLO detections on a sample frame from the broadcast video.

5. How to Run the Code
Place Model and Videos:

Download your best.pt YOLOv11 model file and place it in the same directory as main.py, or update the YOLO_MODEL_PATH variable in main.py to its correct location.

Place your broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4 video files in the same directory as main.py, or update BROADCAST_VIDEO_PATH and TACTICAM_VIDEO_PATH variables in main.py to their correct locations.

Execute the Script:

python main.py

The script will:

Load the YOLOv11 and ResNet50 models.

Process a sample frame from broadcast.mp4 to visualize detections.

Iterate through both broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4, detect players, and extract features.

Perform cross-camera matching.

Save the results to player_id_mapping.csv.

Display progress bars using tqdm.

6. Configuration
You can adjust the following parameters in main.py under the --- Configuration --- section:

YOLO_MODEL_PATH: Path to your YOLOv11 weights.

BROADCAST_VIDEO_PATH: Path to your broadcast video.

TACTICAM_VIDEO_PATH: Path to your tacticam video.

CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD: Minimum confidence score for YOLO detections to be considered (e.g., 0.5).

SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD: Minimum cosine similarity score for two player features to be considered a match (e.g., 0.7).

MAX_FRAME_DIFF: The maximum number of frames difference allowed when searching for a match between a tacticam frame and a broadcast frame. This helps account for slight video desynchronization. (e.g., 5).

OUTPUT_CSV_FILENAME: Name of the output CSV file (player_id_mapping.csv).

SAMPLE_FRAME_OUTPUT_IMAGE: Name of the image file for sample detection visualization (sample_frame_from_broadcast.jpg).

7. Output
Upon successful execution, the script will generate:

player_id_mapping.csv: A CSV file containing the frame-level player matches and their assigned global player_id. Columns include tacticam_frame, broadcast_frame, player_id, and similarity_score.

sample_frame_from_broadcast.jpg: An image file showing YOLOv11 detections on the first frame of the broadcast video, demonstrating the detection capability.

Console output detailing the progress, number of detections, and matches found.

8. Approach and Methodology
The re-identification pipeline follows a sequential approach:

Object Detection: For each frame in both the broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4 videos, the Ultralytics YOLOv11 model (best.pt) is used to detect bounding boxes around players. Detections below a CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD are discarded.

Feature Extraction: For each detected player bounding box, the image region (crop) corresponding to the player is extracted. This crop is then resized and normalized before being fed into a pre-trained ResNet50 model (with its classification layer removed). The output of the ResNet's global average pooling layer serves as a high-dimensional feature vector (embedding) representing the player's appearance.

Cross-Camera Player Matching:

The system iterates through each frame of the tacticam video.

For each player detected in a tacticam frame, it searches for potential matches in a temporal window (MAX_FRAME_DIFF) around the corresponding frame in the broadcast video.

Cosine similarity is calculated between the feature embedding of the tacticam player and every player in the candidate broadcast frames.

The broadcast player with the highest similarity score, provided it exceeds the SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD, is considered a match.

Global ID Assignment: A simple greedy approach is used to assign consistent player_ids. When a match is found:

If either the tacticam player or the broadcast player in the match has already been assigned a player_id from a previous match, that existing ID is used.

If neither has an existing player_id, a new unique player_id is generated and assigned to both players in the match. This helps maintain identity consistency across frames and videos.

9. Challenges and Future Work
Challenges Encountered
Computational Cost: Processing two video streams frame-by-frame with deep learning models (YOLO and ResNet) is computationally intensive.

Temporal Synchronization: The current approach relies on an approximate temporal window (MAX_FRAME_DIFF). Perfect synchronization between arbitrary video feeds is often difficult and can impact matching accuracy.

Occlusions and Viewpoint Changes: Players can be partially or fully occluded, or their appearance can change significantly due to different camera angles, making robust feature extraction and matching challenging.

Identity Switches: Without a dedicated tracking algorithm, the frame-by-frame matching can be prone to identity switches if players with similar appearances are close to each other.

Lack of Ground Truth: Without a ground truth dataset for player identities across frames and videos, quantitative evaluation of accuracy is not possible.

If Incomplete, How to Proceed with More Time and Resources
Given more time and resources, the pipeline could be significantly improved:

Robust Player Tracking (High Priority): Integrate a dedicated multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithm (e.g., DeepSORT, ByteTrack) within each video stream before cross-camera matching. This would assign stable track IDs to players within broadcast.mp4 and tacticam.mp4 independently. The re-identification task would then become matching these stable tracks rather than individual frame-level detections, drastically improving consistency and handling occlusions.

Camera Calibration/Homography: Implement camera calibration techniques or homography estimation to spatially align the two camera views. This would allow for incorporating spatial constraints (e.g., a player at a certain field position in one video should map to a consistent field position in the other).

Advanced Re-ID Networks: Experiment with state-of-the-art person re-identification models specifically designed for robust feature extraction under varying viewpoints and occlusions (e.g., OSNet, BoT-SORT's Re-ID component).

Temporal Consistency in Matching: Beyond a simple frame window, develop more sophisticated temporal matching strategies that consider player trajectories and movement patterns over longer periods.

Data Augmentation and Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the feature extractor (ResNet) on a dataset of soccer players to make its embeddings more discriminative for this specific domain.

Scalability: For very long videos, consider sampling frames or implementing more efficient batch processing.

10. Evaluation Criteria
The success of this re-identification system can be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Accuracy and Reliability of Player Re-identification:

Quantitative: If ground truth data were available, metrics like Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), Multiple Object Tracking Precision (MOTP), Identity F1 Score (IDF1), or Rank-1 accuracy (common in Re-ID benchmarks) would be used.

Qualitative: Visual inspection of the player_id_mapping.csv and overlaying IDs on video frames to check for correct matches and identity switches.
